## Timeline
A simple timeline game build upon [jquery-sortablejs](https://github.com/SortableJS/jquery-sortablejs). It is inspired by the cardgame Timeline, although this is more of a sorting game.
If you are looking for a true Timeline clone, checkout this awesome work by [Tom Jwatson](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/).

## Features
- Add/edit items in the top of _index.html_
- Popup with time when sorting is complete
- Correctly placed cards gets a green border
- Option to enter name (planed to do a highscore list)

## Issues
There are current some functionally that isn't working depending on which OS and browser you are using. Everything should work in Chrome on OSX.

## Translations
I've created this in Danish, but have translated a few parts (code comments), but for the most part, it's a hot mess - sorry!
